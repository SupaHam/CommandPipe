# Introduction
Have you ever wanted to send that one private message in-game, but your Minecraft client would only let you type so many characters? Well, this beauty resolves that issue for you. With at least one character, you can hit return, and keep typing away! Don't believe it? Try it yourself. (You'll have to build it though)
